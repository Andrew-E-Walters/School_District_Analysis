# School_District_Analysis
## Purpose
The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty. This is specifically with reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders as there appears to have been grades altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. She has asked us to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once we have replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would like us to repeat the school district analysis that we did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Overview

This Analysis is going to show us how exactly was the data set of the district analysis and the school analysis affected when we consider the academic dishonesty of 9th Grade students in Thomas High School. The first step in this process was to remove the Math and Reading grades from just that criteria of students. 
#### Data is removed from one of the 9th Grade Students

#### When we filter to the 9th Graders at Thomas High School we see all grades are removed

Once we were able to remove just the relevant data, we could then redo our District and School analysis. It will be interesting to see how exactly this data was impacted by the removal of that subsection of students from the overall data. 

## Results

Once everything was gathered, we could then look at how the new summaries differed from the PyCitySchools analysis we had done for the module.

#### District Summary New

We immediately see a few examples of how this changes the data for the district summary:
- Lower Avg Math Score
- Lower Avg Reading Score
- Lower Overall Passing %
